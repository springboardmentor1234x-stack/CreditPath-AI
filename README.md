# CreditPath-AI: Loan Default Risk Prediction

An AI-powered loan default risk prediction system leveraging machine learning to help banks make data-driven lending decisions. Built with LightGBM, achieving 99.07% AUC-ROC accuracy in the theoretical model.

## Overview

Problem Statement

Loan default risk is a critical challenge in banking affecting profitability, operational costs, and regulatory compliance. Traditional credit assessment methods are manual, time-consuming, and often unable to detect complex risk patterns. CreditPath-AI addresses this by leveraging machine learning to accurately predict loan default probability, enabling banks to manage risk proactively and make strategic decisions.

Why This Matters

Financial Impact: Early identification of risky borrowers can reduce losses by 40-60%.

Operational Efficiency: Automates risk scoring in seconds versus hours of manual review.

Regulatory Compliance: Meets Basel III and RBI guidelines with transparent, auditable models.

Business Value: Supports faster application processing while balancing risk mitigation.

## Key Features

The application is deployed using a stable split deployment approach to meet operational demands:

Live Website Link: https://UmaSupraja.github.io/Credit-Path-AI/

Mandatory Demo Login Flow: The application starts with a secure-feeling Create Account and Sign In feature. (Login uses simple browser memory storage for demonstration purposes.)

Single Prediction: Real-time default risk assessment for individual borrowers via the FastAPI backend.

Actionable Recommendations: Instant probability calculation with color-coded risk levels and business-focused recommendations.

AI Credit Coach: A chat interface that connects to the Google Gemini API to provide general financial and credit health guidance.

Batch Processing (Simulated Feature): Placeholder structure for processing multiple borrowers via CSV upload.

## Installation

Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher

pip package manager

Step 1: Clone Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/UmaSupraja/Credit-Path-AI.git](https://github.com/UmaSupraja/Credit-Path-AI.git)
cd Credit-Path-AI
```

Step 2: Install Backend Dependencies

```bash
# Create and Activate the Environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
# Install the required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

7. Usage

Start Backend Server

To run the API locally for development:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
(The server will be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000.)

Access Frontend

Open the user interface:
```bash
# In your file explorer, double-click this file:
open index.html
```

(The frontend automatically uses the local API address when running the file directly.)
